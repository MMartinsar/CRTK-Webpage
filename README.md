# CRTK Webpage

This is an example of a videogame critic webpage using HTML and later CSS to give it style. 

## Index

It presents a main page (index) that works as a menu giving the possibility to acces eight different pages, the menu, a contact form and six critics. To access them you just need to click on the images of each game and the other two, the menu and the contact
form (accessing the menu is redundant as you are already in it), you can reach them through the nav (navegation bar) that is at the top. A footer was also added with some example information.

I've added some simple animations to the nav and to the images that serve as links to the critics. Nav elements have a slider that changes the color of the button and the images just shrink a bit.

Lastly, a RSS button was added although the tool is currently obsolete due to security problems. It works as a link but it reaches nowhere.

## Critics

The six critic pages also have the nav bar at the top and the footer. This pages consist on text and images having a side banner to accomodate another image that defines the rating of each game. At the bottommost part of this pages, on top of the footer, the main
song of each game was added as an example of including sound.

## Contact form

The contact form is very simple, having inputs for the name, email, telephone number and location of the reader. This inputs are required and they need the correct data for each field (email: example@example.com, telephone number: 123456789). Next, a textarea
was included so the reader can write the message they desire to send the company. Lastly, we have the submit button, which opens the Windows mail application so the message can be finally sent.
